# NaFT — Version-Aware Climate MRV

> **Carbon markets need evidence that survives methodology change.**

**Core value:** Selective re-verification of versioned MRV evidence.
**Blockchain role:** External witness of package lineage, **not climate certification**.

## IEEE ClimateChain 2026 — Independent repository

**Status: PRIVATE. Source IEEE Git history preserved; independent public Pages and Devpost submission pending.**

Destination `main` preserves the original IEEE source HEAD as a real parent/ancestor of a two-parent migration merge commit. The destination bootstrap history remains its first-parent lineage. Eighty IEEE files were transferred byte-identically before destination-only changes, which are recorded separately. The original `NaFT/main`, Source PR #20, frozen refs, Sepolia contract and P1/P2 history have not been modified.

## Four-step proof

1. Inspect the methodology/evidence change in the English ClimateChain UI.
2. Run the deterministic 100-claim **synthetic** experiment: 30 re-verify, 70 unaffected; of the 30, 15 auto and 15 needing evidence.
3. Examine dependency reasoning and package predecessor/successor records for example `CLIMATE-086`.
4. Inspect pre-existing real Ethereum Sepolia P1/P2 transactions and independent read-only verification.

**Boundaries:** the 30/70 ratios belong to a synthetic fixture. No measured farm carbon reduction, 70% cost savings, J-Credit certification, registry acceptance or credit issuance is claimed. Ethereum witnesses package hashes and lineage only.

## Technical scope

Pre-existing NaFT core: version-aware methodology packs, deterministic MRV evidence compiler, dependency/provenance graphs, change impact analysis, selective re-verification, human decision staleness, append-only successor packages.

IEEE-specific work: public-testnet lineage contract and source-bound verifier, ClimateChain judge-first UI and practical synthetic scenario, adversarial tests, responsive design, Devpost assets and video script.

### Run independent verification

```bash
bash tests/run.sh
node tests/climatechain-contract-behavior.test.mjs
bash scripts/verify-live-sepolia.sh
```

Solidity local EVM and browser CI run in GitHub Actions. The original IEEE source CI and the destination's private staging CI both passed 1,234 assertions. Require a **new green `main` CI on the final destination SHA** before any public submission.

### Important origin distinction

The original source deployment commit `fb9016c6c3041ec0e77098e631d62138fbae582e` and Sepolia transaction links deliberately refer to **Takzin1/NaFT**, where the witness was originally deployed. Do not rewrite historical source references merely to make them appear native to the new repository.
